The rest of this page contains audio samples of the concurrent speech configurations used in this project. These are best heard using stereo headphones or earphones.

# Audio Clips:

## The 5 Configurations

A sample audio file for each of the 5 configurations of variables can be found below. These are stereo recordings of the spatial audio file generated using [Resonance Audio](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/) and [Unity](https://unity.com/).

## The Task Prompt

Given below is an example task prompt. You can then listen to the audio files sequentially to simulate the process of search for the relevant headline in pairs.

***"You regularly follow Cricket, and often look for articles related to the Indian Cricket team whenever you read news headlines. In the following list of headlines, find the one that is most related to Indian Cricket."***

## Concurrent Speech

A base Indian Accent voice from [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) was initially chosen for further processing.

- Sample file of the base Indian accent female voice (Aditi)

    </audio>
    

Voice Synthesis using the [Praat Software](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) resulted in the following voice types:

- Androgynous Voice

    <audio controls>
        <source src="../media/torchaudio/14_AndrogynousPraat.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Sorry but it seems that your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    
- Male Voice

    <audio controls>
        <source src="../media/torchaudio/15_MalePraat.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Sorry but it seems that your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>

- Female Voice

        Sorry but it seems that your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    

For the final experiment, in addition to the base voice, two other American accent voices were used.

- Sample file of the American accent male voice (Matthew, Amazon Polly)

    <audio controls>
        <source src="../media/torchaudio/17_MatthewSample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Sorry but it seems that your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio>
    
- Sample file of the American accent female voice (Salli, Amazon Polly)

    <audio controls>
        <source src="../media/torchaudio/18_SalliSample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Sorry but it seems that your browser does not support the audio element.
