# Hello there

My name is Rishi Vanukuru, and I'm a second year PhD student in the [ATLAS Institute](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. 

I am advised by [Ellen Do](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/ellen-yi-luen-do), and work at the [ACME Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/acme-lab), where my research explores the design of immersive interfaces that support learning, creativity, and collaboration. I design and build cross-device, cross-reality ecosystems that enable people to work together, both in-person and remotely, making the most of whatever devices they have access to.

Before joining ATLAS, I completed an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering, and a graduate degree in Interaction Design (where I was a member of the [Immersive Media Experience Design Lab](https://imxd.in)), both from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
