# Hello there

My name is Rishi Vanukuru, and I'm a Research Associate at the IDC School of Design, IIT Bombay, India.

I work at the [IMXD Lab](https://imxd.in), in the areas of HCI, Immersive Media, and Accessibility.

I completed my Master's in Interaction Design from the IDC in 2020. Before joining the IDC, I was an undergraduate student at IIT Bombay (2014 - 2018), where I majored in Civil Engineering with a minor degree in Design.
