# Hello there

My name is Rishi Vanukuru, and I'm a first year PhD student in the [ATLAS Institute](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/), University of Colorado Boulder. 

I am advised by Prof. [Ellen Do](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/ellen-yi-luen-do), and work at the [ACME Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/acme-lab), where my research explores the design of immersive interfaces that support learning, creativity, and collaboration.

Before joining ATLAS, I completed an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering, and a graduate degree in Interaction Design, both from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
