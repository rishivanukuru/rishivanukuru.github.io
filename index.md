# About

Hello there! My name is Rishi. I'm currently a third-year PhD student in the [ATLAS Institute](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am advised by [Ellen Do](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/ellen-yi-luen-do), and work at the [ACME Lab](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/acme-lab). Before joining ATLAS, I completed an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering, and a graduate degree in Interaction Design (where I was a member of the [IMXD Lab](https://imxd.in)), both from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.

# Research

_For a more details, here's a list of [publications](/publications), and a link to my [CV](/cv)._

My (high-level) goal is to **support people as they make meaning and memories while collaborating across distance, time, and devices**. Space, and spatial interaction, is a crucial aspect of how meaning and memories are made in everyday life. Through my research, I explore how we can **maximize the potential of everyday devices like mobile phones and tablets for spatial computing**, and study how this changes the way people work together in hybrid environments. 

For example, in the [DualStream](projects/dualstream) project (also [here](/dualstream)), we showcase how mobile phones can be used to support practical forms of spatial remote communication in a range of contexts. More recently, we have been exploring how these concepts can apply to asynchronous interactions, through [Spatial Mobile Memories](/assets/documents/papers/imx2024memories.pdf).

During my PhD, I've also been fortunate to work with: 
- The [Intentional Meetings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/intentional-meetings/) team at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/), on supporting intentionality across meetings using Generative AI (Summer 2024).
- Ericsson Research (CA, USA), on developing systems for spatial remote communication that adapt to changing network conditions (Summer 2023).

<!-- In my research, I draw from theories of embodied interaction and spatial computing to design and build cross-device ecosystems for collaboration centered around everyday devices, and study how people make meaning and memories as they collaborate using such hybrid interfaces. -->

# Design

Some other things I've worked on over the years:
- A [mobile AR application](/projects/sxrp) to play games with friends across distances.
- A real-time [VR music visualization experience](/projects/musicvr) for people playing the piano.
- Experiments with [paper prototyping for AR applications](/projects/arprototyping).
- A [podcast](/projects/styrofoam) about applying to graduate design programs in India.
- Some [speculative design](/projects/designfiction) (and a short story) about the future of conversational AI.
- A large-scale [expressive typewriter installation](/projects/expresso).
- A series of [comic strips](/projects/bipolarspectacles), and a [photobook](/projects/shadows-photobook) about the undergraduate experience at IIT Bombay.

# Beyond

## Music

I've been sporadically writing songs and composing music for a few years now. Some of my work can be found on my [Soundcloud Page](https://soundcloud.com/rishivanukuru). 

In another life, I was part of a semi-professional blues rock band, with five friends of mine. We were called Bluemoss.
