This is an ongoing project about AR interaction methods. We are exploring the possible interactions afforded by the use of a second mobile phone as a controller for Handheld AR.

I designed an Android app named 'ARTWO' to demonstrate some of these interactions. You can download the app and find out more at the following link:
