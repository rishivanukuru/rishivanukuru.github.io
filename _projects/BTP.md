As part of my Undergraduate Degree Project, I worked on research into the applications of biological computational models to multimodal transport network design. 

The _Physarm Polycephalum_ (more commonly known as a Slime Mould) has been found to be quite adept at solving network design and route assignment problems. While past work in the area had used multi-agent models of the slime mould to do the same computationally, my work explored the use of slime mould agents with different behaviours (each meant to represent a real-world mode of transport) within the same simulation.  

A research publication regarding the same titled ["Multimodal Transportation Network Design Using Physarum Polycephalum-Inspired Multi-agent Computation Methods."](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77538-8_8), can be found in the proceedings of the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation 2018.
