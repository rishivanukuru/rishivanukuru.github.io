This is an ongoing project about cross-device, cross-reality tools for both co-located and remote collaboration.

A brief overview of the project can be found in the following workshop paper: 

Rishi Vanukuru, Ellen Yi-Luen Do. **Exploring the use of Mobile Devices as a Bridge for Cross-Reality Collaboration**. _To appear in: IEEE ISMAR 2023 Workshop on Cross-Reality Interactions._ [Preprint](/assets/documents/papers/ismar2023crossreality.pdf)

The following video showcases some of the interactions involved when a group of co-located users work together using Mobile Augmented Reality and Head-worn AR.
