As part of the [IMXD Lab](https://imxd.in), I worked on the [**ScholAR Remote Classroom**](https://imxd.in/projects/mobilesocialar) project, where we explored the use of Social Augmented Reality to support remote education, with a focus on mathematics education for middle school. I was involved involved in the study design and execution aspects of the project, and also helped with the technical development of the application.

The application helps students and teachers interact with each other as if they were in the same physical space. The following video demo would give you a better idea of what the application is capable of -

In the demo, a teacher is able to conduct a short class with 5 students using our application, and they can move around, talk to each other, and interact with 3D models as well.

Our motivation behind working on this project was to bring back the spatial and social aspects of classroom learning, something that is difficult to recreate in conventional video-call based classes. Our focus was to use this application to conduct short, spatial learning activities for middle school mathematics classes (such as visualising solid shapes and mensuration).
