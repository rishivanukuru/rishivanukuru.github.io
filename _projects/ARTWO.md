This is an ongoing project about AR interaction methods, where we're exploring the possible uses of a second mobile phone as a controller for Handheld AR.

Here's a short explainer video (from our VRST 2020 Submission):

The associated publications do a good job of explaining the work we've done so far:

One main component of the project is the Android App "ARTWO" that I designed and developed to demonstrate some of the possible interactions and benefits of dual phone AR. You can download the app and find out more at the following link:

 [**ARTWO - Dual Phone AR - Home Page**](https://rishivanukuru.com/artwo/). 
 
 You can download ARTWO for Android on the Google Play Store.
