The Styrofoam Podcast was the result of a short course on Instructional Design in February 2019. 
Season 1 consists of 5 episodes, each about various aspects relevant to the Common Entrance Exam for Design or CEED (the main entrance exam for Master's level Design programs in India). The idea was to create a series of short and engaging episodes where current Design students discuss their reasons for wanting to pursue higher studies in the field, and talk about their journey preparing for and getting through CEED.

As part of a group of 10 M.Des students, I worked on creating the content and scripting the podcasts. I also helped record and produce the final episodes, and appeared as a speaker on 4 of them.

As of October 2020, the episodes as a whole have had over 25,000 plays on Soundcloud. You can check them out below:
