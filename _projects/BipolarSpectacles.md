Making comics based on campus life at IITB was something that I wanted to do for quite some time. An initial attempt at realising the same can be found on an old blog I put up for the purpose, here - [Bipolar Spectacles Wordpress](https://bipolarspectacles.wordpress.com/).

In my final year as an undergrad, I was able to expand upon the idea and create a book compiling a series of comic panels and stories. The final version of this book, as of December 2017, can be viewed below.
